# Welcome to BaseCamp Planner
BaseCamp Planner is a front-end application that I created for my front-end capstone project in the first 3-months of my time in the Nashville Software School full-stack developer bootcamp.

## About BaseCamp Planner
Organizing an outdoors recreation roadtrip can be difficult, especially if you are unfamiliar with the area of travel. There can be an overwhelming amount of places to stay and activities to fit into your schedule. This applicaton is intended to make the planning process effective and efficient for a user, while also providing a fun and explorative user experieince.

## Features
* User account data
* Explore Base Camp locations and hiking trails using an interactive map
* Create/save multiple trip plans and add BaseCamp locations/dates
* Add hiking trails to Base Camp plans that are saved on a trip
* Integrated Google Map feature to more thouroughly investigate preloaded Base Camp locations
* Edit and cancel trips/plans
* Manage user account info
  
## Useage Note!!
* Data input for this application is still in progress. Only the following states on the map have full functionality:
  - California, Arizona, Utah, North Carolina, Maine.
* State Maps with only base camp data, but no hikes include:
  - Washington, Oregon, Nevada, Alaska, Hawaii, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Tennessee, New York
* This application requires a secret API key for Google Maps to function properly. If you clone this application, it will not contain an API key and the google maps feature will not load, but the application will still work.
